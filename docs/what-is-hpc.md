# What is high performance computing?

High performance computing (HPC) is also called 'big compute', and uses large clusters of computers to solve complex tasks. This is often done using parallel processing where multiple tasks are executed alongside each other (at the same time) to increase the speed.

## Use cases for HPC

Some examples, but definitely not limited to:

- Deep learning
- Rendering of images or videos
- 'Big data' analysis
- Complex mathematical tasks
